Subject: Quick question on turn-taking

Hey [First Name],

I'm David. I’ve spent over 10 years working on speech understanding, including launching Sonos Voice Control, bringing real-time transcription and voice activity detection to millions of users.

I recently co-founded Blynt AI, and I am in discovery mode, that's why I am reaching out.

As I speak with teams building voice agents (Sandra AI, Vocca AI, Doctolib, Marshmallow), I keep hearing the same pain I faced myself: 👉 handling **turn-taking** without lag or interruptions.

Not a pitch, I’d love to hear how you’re approaching it. We’re comparing insights across teams right now.

Would you be open to a quick 20-minute chat?

Best,
David

Subject: Bench notes on Flux/Vogent

Hey [First Name],

I’ve been helping a few teams recently, one in healthcare, another building a kids voice agent, evaluate their speech AI stack.

We’ve benchmarked several approaches, including Flux (Deepgram), Vogent. Have you heard about this new [evaluataton framework](https://ericsunkuan.github.io/full-duplex-bench-v2-demo/) for turn-taking? 

Want the one‑slide summary? I can walk you through it in 15 min.

Best,
David

Subject: Last note — early access to Blynt AI Studio

Hey [First Name],

We’re opening our Blynt AI Studio: upload a few audios and get a side‑by‑side of your stack vs. alternative models on:
- latency/barge‑in
- overlap handling/double‑talk
- domain WER stability

If you want early access, I can set you up this week. If not, all good, happy to send the benchmark one‑pager instead.

Best,
David
