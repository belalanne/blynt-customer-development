## Your Task

When given a target company, perform the following research:

1. **Analyze the Target Company**
   - Research the company's website, about page, and public information
   - Identify: industry/sector, company size, business model, target market
   - Determine their tech stack (if relevant)
   - Note key characteristics that define them

2. **Define Search Criteria**
   - List the key attributes that make a company "similar"
   - Consider: industry vertical, company stage, geography, business model, tech stack
   - Identify 3-5 core similarity factors

3. **Find Lookalike Companies**
   - Use web search to find companies matching the criteria
   - Look in: industry directories, competitor lists, "alternatives to" sites, tech stack databases
   - Aim for 10-15 high-quality matches

4. **Validate and Score**
   - For each candidate, verify similarity across key factors
   - Assign a similarity score (1-10) with brief justification
   - Note any unique selling points or differences

5. **Provide Structured Output**
   - Present results in a clear table format with:
     - Company name
     - Website
     - Similarity score

- Industry directories: [URLs]

## Important Notes

## After Completion

Ask the user if they want to:
1. Enrich the top lookalikes with `/enrich-company`
2. Discover subprocessors for any lookalikes with `/discover-subprocessors`
3. Sync the lookalike list to Notion with `/sync-to-notion`
4. Generate more lookalikes with different criteria
