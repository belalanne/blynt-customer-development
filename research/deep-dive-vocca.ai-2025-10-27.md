## 7. Sales Intelligence & Outreach Recommendations

### Key Decision Makers
1. **Eliott Hoffenberg** (CEO) - Primary contact for partnerships
2. **Hugo Danet** (Co-Founder) - Technical decision maker
3. **Alexandre Dupuis** (Co-Founder) - Product/operations

### Outreach Angles

#### If selling ASR/Speech Technology:
- **Competitive Angle:** Position against Deepgram with better French language accuracy, healthcare-specific models, or pricing
- **Challenge:** They're already using Deepgram and CEO has public relationship with them
- **Timing:** Wait for contract renewal or scaling pain points

#### If selling LLM/NLU Services:
- **Opportunity:** No public disclosure of LLM provider = potential openness
- **Value Props:** Healthcare-specific fine-tuning, French language excellence, GDPR compliance, cost optimization
- **Timing:** Good timing as they scale (4M+ calls = significant LLM costs)

#### If selling Complementary Services:
- **Analytics/Monitoring:** Call quality analysis, conversation intelligence
- **Integration Partners:** EHR/EMR integrations, calendar systems
- **Compliance:** GDPR/healthcare data privacy tools

### Company Maturity Assessment
- **Stage:** Early growth (post-seed, 18 employees)
- **Budget:** Funded ($5.5M) but cost-conscious
- **Decision Speed:** Likely fast (startup agility)
- **Technical Sophistication:** High (AI-first company)

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Monitor for hiring signals (ML engineers, infrastructure roles)
2. Track funding announcements for Series A timing
3. Connect with co-founders on LinkedIn
4. Attend French healthcare tech events where they might present
5. Reference their Deepgram case study in discovery calls (shows you've done research)
